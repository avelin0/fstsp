Abstract = {Speedy delivery of products is important for customers and the
   optimization of the last mile has particular challenges. In recent years
   drone-supported delivery has become increasingly feasible and therefore
   a topic of intense research. In this paper we address a traveling
   salesman problem where a truck has to serve customers and can use drones
   as flying sidekicks for the delivery of parcels. The goal is to assign
   customers to be either served by the truck or by some drone and schedule
   all events in order to minimize the total completion time of whole
   operation. We propose a heuristic for this problem, and introduce
   several novel components, including a multi-armed bandit selection for
   partitioning customers, an efficient matching-based heuristic for
   assigning drones to customers, local searches to improve solutions, and
   a fast greedy scheduler to estimate solution quality. In computational
   experiments we show that the combined approach finds better solutions
   than current methods, in less time.},

Abstract = {The efficiency and dynamism of unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, have
   presented substantial application opportunities in several industries in
   the last years. Notably, logistic companies have given close attention
   to these vehicles to reduce delivery time and operational cost. A
   variant of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), called the flying
   sidekick traveling salesman problem, was introduced involving
   drone-assisted parcel delivery. The drone launches from the truck,
   proceeds to deliver parcels to a customer, and then is recovered by the
   truck at a third location. While the drone travels through a trip, the
   truck delivers parcels to other customers as long as the drone has
   enough battery to hover waiting for the truck. This work proposes a
   hybrid heuristic where the initial solution is created from the optimal
   TSP solution reached by a TSP solver. Next, an implementation of the
   general variable neighborhood search is employed to obtain the delivery
   routes of truck and drone. Computational experiments show the potential
   of the algorithm to improve significantly delivery time. Furthermore, we
   provide a new set of instances based on the well-known traveling
   salesman problem library instances.},

Abstract = {Drones are the latest trend in commercial logistics research, especially
   in the context of last-mile delivery. Combining a drone and a truck
   offers numerous distinctive capabilities that introduce new
   opportunities to enhance the performance of the last-mile delivery
   system even further. To deal with the challenges of routing optimization
   for the combined system, the present paper proposes a new mathematical
   formulation and a new heuristic approach based on Adaptive Large
   Neighborhood Search (ALNS) for the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman
   Problem (FSTSP) with multiple drops (multi-drop FSTSP). The
   effectiveness of the proposed approach was demonstrated in several test
   instances, some of which are based on a real case delivery problem in
   Indonesia. It appears that the proposed ALNS approach performs better
   than the state-of-the-art method adapted from the previous literature.},

Title = {The flying sidekick traveling salesman problem with stochastic travel
   time: A reinforcement learning approach},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {As a novel urban delivery approach, the coordinated operation of a
   truck-drone pair has gained increasing popularity, where the truck takes
   a traveling salesman route and the drone launches from the truck to
   deliver packages to nearby customers. Previous studies have referred to
   this problem as the flying sidekick traveling salesman problem (FSTSP)
   and have proposed numerous algorithms to solve it. However, few studies
   have considered the stochasticity of the travel time on the road
   network, mainly caused by traffic congestion, harsh weather conditions,
   etc, which heavily impacts the speed of the truck, thus affecting the
   drone's operations and overall delivery routine. In this study, we
   extend the FSTSP with stochastic travel times and formulate the problem
   into a Markov decision process (MDP). The model is solved using
   reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms including the deep Q-network
   (DQN) and the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm to overcome the
   curse of dimensionality. Using an artificially generated dataset that
   was widely accepted as benchmarks in the literature, we show that the
   reinforcement learning algorithms also perform well as approximate
   optimization algorithms, outperforming a mixed integer programming (MIP)
   model and a local search heuristic algorithm on the original FSTSP
   without the stochastic travel time. On the FSTSP with stochastic travel
   time, the reinforcement learning algorithms obtain flexible policies
   that make dynamic decisions based on different traffic conditions on the
   roads, saving up to 28.65\% on delivery time compared with the MIP model
   and a dynamic local search (DLS) algorithm. We also conduct a case study
   using real-time traffic data collected in a middle-sized city in the
   U.S. using Google Map API. Compared with a benchmark calculated by the
   DLS, the DRL approach saves 32.68\% total delivery time in the case
   study, showing great potential for future practical adoption.},

Abstract = {The use of drones in urban logistics is gaining more and more interest.
   In this paper we consider the flying sidekick traveling salesman
   problem, where some customers require a delivery and they can be served
   either by a truck or by a drone. The aim is minimizing the total time
   required to service all the customers.
   We present a branch and bound algorithm especially designed to
   efficiently target small instances up to 15 customers and a heuristic
   algorithm, using the branch and bound as a subroutine, to attack larger
   instances. Extensive experimental results suggest the effectiveness of
   the exact solver for small instances and shows that the heuristic is
   able to provide state-of-the-art results for medium/large instances. (C)

   salesman problem},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {124},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The flying sidekick traveling salesman problem (FS-TSP) is a parcel
   delivery problem arising in the last-mile logistics, where the
   distribution plan of a driver-operated truck assisted by a drone
   (unmanned aerial vehicle, UAV) has to be defined. The FS-TSP is a
   variant of the TSP where routing decisions are integrated with
   customer-to-drone and customer-to-truck assignment decisions and
   truck-and-drone synchronization constraints. The objective is the
   minimization of the time required to serve all the customers, taking
   into account drone payload capacity and battery power constraints. In
   this work we provide a new representation of the FS-TSP based on the
   definition of an extended graph. This representation allows to model the
   problem by a new and compact integer linear programming formulation,
   where the synchronization issue is tackled in a column generation
   fashion, thus avoiding the usage of big-M constraints, representing one
   of the main drawbacks of the models present in literature. The proposed
   formulation has been solved by an exact approach which combines a
   Branch-and-Cut algorithm and a column generation procedure, strengthened
   by variable fixing strategies and new valid inequalities specifically
   defined for the problem. The proposed method has been experienced on a
   large set of benchmark instances. Computational results show that the
   proposed approach either is competitive or outperforms the best exact
   approach present in literature for the FS-TSP. Indeed, it is able to
   provide the optimal solution for all small size instances with 10
   customers and for several medium size instances with 20 customers, some
   of them never solved before.},

Abstract = {This article considers a version of the flying sidekick traveling
   salesman problem in which parcels are delivered to customers by either a
   truck or a set of identical flying drones. The flights of the drones are
   limited by the battery endurance and each flight is made of a launch, a
   service to a customer, and a return: launch and return must happen when
   the truck is stationary. These operations require time and when multiple
   drones are launched and/or collected at the same node, their order
   becomes relevant. The proposed model takes into account the order of
   these operations as a scheduling problem, because ignoring it could lead
   to infeasible solutions in the reality due to the possible exceeding of
   the drones endurance. We propose a set of novel formulations for the
   problem that can improve the size of the largest instances solved in the
   literature. We provide a comparison among the formulations, between the
   multiple drones solutions and the single drone ones, and among different
   variants of the model.},

Volume = {120},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This research considers unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that may travel
   at varying speeds in a last-mile delivery system involving a single
   truck and a fleet of UAVs. In existing truck-and-UAV delivery models
   that assume constant or unlimited UAV endurance, the natural conclusion
   is that operating UAVs at higher speeds will either decrease, or have no
   adverse effect on, total delivery times. However, in reality, UAV power
   consumption is a nonlinear function of both speed and parcel weight;
   flying at high speeds can dramatically reduce flight ranges, thus
   limiting the effectiveness of these logistics systems. This paper
   addresses the tradeoffs between speed and range in a new variant of the
   combined truck/UAV delivery problem in which UAV speeds are treated as
   decision variables. A three-phased algorithm is provided that
   dynamically adjusts UAV speeds to achieve superior performance, with the
   goal of minimizing the total delivery time (or makespan). Results
   indicate that significant time savings can be achieved by operating UAVs
   at variable speeds. Furthermore, under certain conditions, optimizing
   UAV speeds also results in shorter truck travel distances, reduced UAV
   energy consumption per trip, and less UAV loitering while waiting to
   rendezvous with the truck.},

Abstract = {Once limited to the military domain, unmanned aerial vehicles are now
   poised to gain widespread adoption in the commercial sector. One such
   application is to deploy these aircraft, also known as drones, for
   last-mile delivery in logistics operations. While significant research
   efforts are underway to improve the technology required to enable
   delivery by drone, less attention has been focused on the operational
   challenges associated with leveraging this technology. This paper
   provides two mathematical programming models aimed at optimal routing
   and scheduling of unmanned aircraft, and delivery trucks, in this new
   paradigm of parcel delivery. In particular, a unique variant of the
   classical vehicle routing problem is introduced, motivated by a scenario
   in which an unmanned aerial vehicle works in collaboration with a
   traditional delivery truck to distribute parcels. We present mixed
   integer linear programming formulations for two delivery-by-drone
   problems, along with two simple, yet effective, heuristic solution
   approaches to solve problems of practical size. Solutions to these
   problems will facilitate the adoption of unmanned aircraft for last-mile
   delivery. Such a delivery system is expected to provide faster receipt
   of customer orders at less cost to the distributor and with reduced
   environmental impacts. A numerical analysis demonstrates the
   effectiveness of the heuristics and investigates the tradeoffs between
   using drones with faster flight speeds versus longer endurance. (C) 2015

Abstract = {This paper considers a last-mile delivery system in which a delivery

   problem is first formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP).
   However, owing to the computational complexity of this problem, only
   trivially-sized problems may be solved directly via the MILP. Thus, a
   heuristic solution approach that consists of solving a sequence of three
   subproblems is proposed. Extensive numerical testing demonstrates that
   this approach effectively solves problems of practical size within
   reasonable runtimes. Additional analysis quantifies the potential time
   savings associated with employing multiple UAVs. The analysis also
   reveals that additional UAVs may have diminishing marginal returns. An

Abstract = {In this paper, we present a routing heuristic for the Flying Sidekick
   Traveling Salesman Problem. This problem combines a single truck with a
   single drone. The drone may be launched from the truck from a customer
   location and can make a single package delivery before being recovered
   by the truck. While the drone is in flight, the truck can deliver
   packages independently. The problem is one of simultaneously assigning
   the customers to each vehicle and determining the synchronized routes
   for both vehicles to satisfy all customer demands in the shortest time
   possible. The problem is NP-hard. Our main contribution lies in
   developing a novel split algorithm that utilizes a shortest path
   approach for determining the optimal routing solution to a given order
   of customer locations. This split algorithm has polynomial complexity.
   We develop a heuristic solution to the problem by combining the split
   algorithm with local search techniques. This overall heuristic is shown
   to be accurate and computationally scalable to large, realistically
   sized problems applicable in last-mile logistics.},

Abstract = {The truck-drone hybrid delivery system uses a truck as a station for
   drones in addition to its delivery function and is getting attention
   because the strengths of these individual vehicles can be selectively
   and synergistically exploited. In this study, we extended the previous
   vehicle routing models to the hybrid delivery systems by taking into
   account two important practical issues: the effect of parcel weight on
   drone energy consumption and restricted flying areas. The flight range
   of the drones is heavily susceptible to the loaded weight due to the
   limited battery life. Drones are also not allowed to fly over sensitive
   facilities regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or
   temporarily in certain areas due to weather-related conditions. We
   developed a mathematical model that incorporates these issues and
   propose a two-phase constructive and search heuristic algorithm to
   provide computational efficiency of the real-world cases problems. The
   result of the numerical study demonstrates the effectiveness and
   efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

Title = {A multi-agent approach to the truck multi-drone routing problem},

Abstract = {In this work, we address the Truck-multi-Drone Team Logistics Problem
   (TmDTL), devoted to visit a set of points with a truck helped by a team
   of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones in the minimum time,
   starting at a certain location and ending at a different one. It is an
   enhanced version of the multiple Flying Sidekicks Traveling Salesman
   Problem (mFSTSP) presented in Murray and Raj (2020) wherein drones are
   allowed to visit several customers per trip. In order to cope with large
   instances of the complex TmDTL, we have developed a novel agent-based
   method where agents represent the points that are going to be visited by
   vehicles. Agents evolve by means of movement inside a grid (locations
   vs. vehicles) according to a set of rules in the seek of better
   objective function values. Each agent needs to explore only a fraction
   of the complete problem, sharing its progress with the rest of the
   agents which are coordinated by one central agent which helps to
   maintain an asynchronous memory of solutions - e.g. on the control of
   the mechanism to escape from local minima. Our agent-based approach is
   firstly tested using the largest instances of the single TDTL problem
   reported in the literature, which additionally serves as upper bounds to
   the TmDTL problem. Secondly, we have solved instances up to 500
   locations with up to 6 drones in the fleet. Thirdly, we have tested the
   behavior of our approach in 500 locations problems with up to 8 drones
   in order to test the fleet size sensitivity. Our experiments demonstrate
   the ability of the proposed agent-based system to obtain good quality
   solutions for complex optimization problems that arise. Further, the
   abstraction in solutions coding applied makes the agent-based approach
   scalable and flexible enough to be applied to a wide range of other
   optimization problems.},

Title = {An adaptive large neighborhood search metaheuristic for the vehicle
   routing problem with drones},

Abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, commonly known as drones, have attained
   considerable interest in recent years due to the potential of
   revolutionizing transport and logistics. Amazon were among the first to
   introduce the idea of using drones to deliver goods, followed by several
   other distribution companies working on similar services.
   The Traveling Salesman Problem, frequently used for planning last-mile
   delivery operations, can easily be modified to incorporate drones,
   resulting in a routing problem involving both the truck and aircraft.
   Introduced by Murray and Chu (2015), the Flying Sidekick Traveling
   Salesman Problem considers a drone and truck collaborating. The drone
   can be launched and recovered at certain visits on the truck route,
   making it possible for both vehicles to deliver goods to customers in
   parallel. This generalization considerably decreases the operational
   cost of the routes, by reducing the total fuel consumption for the
   truck, as customers on the routes can be serviced by drones without
   covering additional miles for the trucks, and hence increase
   productivity.
   In this paper a mathematical model is formulated, defining a problem
   similar to the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem, but for the
   capacitated multiple-truck case with time limit constraints and
   minimizing cost as objective function. The corresponding problem is
   denoted the Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones. Due to the difficulty
   of solving large instances to optimality, an Adaptive Large Neighborhood
   Search metaheuristic is proposed. Finally, extensive computational
   experiments are carried out. The tests investigate, among other things,
   how beneficial the inclusion of the drone-delivery option is compared to
   delivering all items using exclusively trucks. Moreover, a detailed
   sensitivity analysis is performed on several drone-parameters of
   interest.},

Title = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Last-Mile Delivery Considering Backhauls},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {85017-85033},
Abstract = {Utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles for delivery service has been drawing
   attention in the logistics industry. Since commercial unmanned aerial
   vehicles have fundamental limitations on payloads and battery
   capacities, hybrid ground vehicle and unmanned aerial vehicle models
   have been actively investigated as practical solutions. However, these
   studies have focused on linehaul (delivery) demands, excluding a large
   number of backhaul (pickup) demands. If we consider both demands at the
   same time, an empty unmanned aerial vehicle that finished linehaul
   service can be immediately used to serve a backhaul customer. In this
   study, we investigate the differences that arise by considering
   backhauls as an additional element of the routing problem. A mixed
   integer linear programming model is developed, and a heuristic is
   constructed to solve large-scale problems. To demonstrate the
   effectiveness of our model, we compare it to existing models using a
   real-world example. Our solution is also evaluated based on experiments
   employing a large number of randomly generated datasets.},
