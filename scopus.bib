abstract={Based on the research on the coordinated delivery mode of drones and trucks that has emerged in recent years, the analysis is mainly from the perspective of the mapping relationship between drones and vehicles, including single-vehicle single-drone mapping mode (TSP-D), single-vehicle multi-drone mapping mode (TSP-mD) and multi-vehicle multi-drone mapping mode (MTSPD). In the TSP-D, four modes of coordinated delivery of drones and trucks are mainly summarized, including the flying sidekick traveling salesman problem (FSTSP), the parallel drone scheduling traveling salesman problem (PDSTSP), the vehicle guarantee drone traveling salesman problem (VGDTSP) and the drone guarantee vehicle traveling salesman problem (DGVTSP). In the TSP-mD, the relevant documents are mainly summarized based on the VGDTSP. In the multiple traveling salesman problem with drones (MTSPD), the relevant documents are mainly summarized based on the FSTSP. The same variants and different variants of the three mapping modes are explored, and the targets, algorithms, related parameters and constraints in the current coordinated delivery mode of drones and trucks are summarized and analyzed. Considering actual performance analysis and heterogeneous drone optimization in the coordinated delivery model of drones and vehicles, this research will have important reference value and guiding significance for future research and practical applications. © 2023 Chinese Institute of Electronics.

abstract={Delivering parcels using a combination of drones and trucks represents a promising new package delivery method. In previous studies, several truck/drone delivery planning problems and their solutions have been proposed. However, little research has been done to determine which delivery method is most appropriate. The reason for this is that it is difficult to obtain an exact solution for such problems, and thus the accuracy of the solutions is an issue. In this study, we propose an accurate solution procedure for the flying sidekick travelling salesman problem (FSTSP) and the parallel drone scheduling travelling salesman problem (PDSTSP), and establish which delivery method is most suitable based on the solutions obtained. © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Drones are the latest trend in commercial logistics research, especially in the context of last-mile delivery. Combining a drone and a truck offers numerous distinctive capabilities that introduce new opportunities to enhance the performance of the last-mile delivery system even further. To deal with the challenges of routing optimization for the combined system, the present paper proposes a new mathematical formulation and a new heuristic approach based on Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) for the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem (FSTSP) with multiple drops (multi-drop FSTSP). The effectiveness of the proposed approach was demonstrated in several test instances, some of which are based on a real case delivery problem in Indonesia. It appears that the proposed ALNS approach performs better than the state-of-the-art method adapted from the previous literature. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={As a novel urban delivery approach, the coordinated operation of a truck–drone pair has gained increasing popularity, where the truck takes a traveling salesman route and the drone launches from the truck to deliver packages to nearby customers. Previous studies have referred to this problem as the flying sidekick traveling salesman problem (FSTSP) and have proposed numerous algorithms to solve it. However, few studies have considered the stochasticity of the travel time on the road network, mainly caused by traffic congestion, harsh weather conditions, etc, which heavily impacts the speed of the truck, thus affecting the drone's operations and overall delivery routine. In this study, we extend the FSTSP with stochastic travel times and formulate the problem into a Markov decision process (MDP). The model is solved using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms including the deep Q-network (DQN) and the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm to overcome the curse of dimensionality. Using an artificially generated dataset that was widely accepted as benchmarks in the literature, we show that the reinforcement learning algorithms also perform well as approximate optimization algorithms, outperforming a mixed integer programming (MIP) model and a local search heuristic algorithm on the original FSTSP without the stochastic travel time. On the FSTSP with stochastic travel time, the reinforcement learning algorithms obtain flexible policies that make dynamic decisions based on different traffic conditions on the roads, saving up to 28.65% on delivery time compared with the MIP model and a dynamic local search (DLS) algorithm. We also conduct a case study using real-time traffic data collected in a middle-sized city in the U.S. using Google Map API. Compared with a benchmark calculated by the DLS, the DRL approach saves 32.68% total delivery time in the case study, showing great potential for future practical adoption. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this work, we address the Truck-multi-Drone Team Logistics Problem (TmDTL), devoted to visit a set of points with a truck helped by a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones in the minimum time, starting at a certain location and ending at a different one. It is an enhanced version of the multiple Flying Sidekicks Traveling Salesman Problem (mFSTSP) presented in Murray and Raj (2020) wherein drones are allowed to visit several customers per trip. In order to cope with large instances of the complex TmDTL, we have developed a novel agent-based method where agents represent the points that are going to be visited by vehicles. Agents evolve by means of movement inside a grid (locations vs. vehicles) according to a set of rules in the seek of better objective function values. Each agent needs to explore only a fraction of the complete problem, sharing its progress with the rest of the agents which are coordinated by one central agent which helps to maintain an asynchronous memory of solutions – e.g. on the control of the mechanism to escape from local minima. Our agent-based approach is firstly tested using the largest instances of the single TDTL problem reported in the literature, which additionally serves as upper bounds to the TmDTL problem. Secondly, we have solved instances up to 500 locations with up to 6 drones in the fleet. Thirdly, we have tested the behavior of our approach in 500 locations problems with up to 8 drones in order to test the fleet size sensitivity. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of the proposed agent-based system to obtain good quality solutions for complex optimization problems that arise. Further, the abstraction in solutions coding applied makes the agent-based approach scalable and flexible enough to be applied to a wide range of other optimization problems. © 2022 The Author(s)},

abstract={This paper presents three enhanced formulations for the flying sidekick traveling salesman problem, where a truck and a drone cooperate to deliver parcels to customers minimizing the completion time. The drone can leave and must return to the truck after visiting one customer, performing flights not exceeding its battery endurance while the truck can serve other customers. The new formulations allow to decrease the number of “big-M” constraints with respect to literature models and improve previous results by solving to optimality several benchmark instances for which an optimal solution was previously unknown. This paper also shows how to modify the new models to include several variants of the problem from the literature. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={The use of drones in urban logistics is gaining more and more interest. In this paper we consider the flying sidekick traveling salesman problem, where some customers require a delivery and they can be served either by a truck or by a drone. The aim is minimizing the total time required to service all the customers. We present a branch and bound algorithm especially designed to efficiently target small instances up to 15 customers and a heuristic algorithm, using the branch and bound as a subroutine, to attack larger instances. Extensive experimental results suggest the effectiveness of the exact solver for small instances and shows that the heuristic is able to provide state-of-the-art results for medium/large instances. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This article considers a version of the flying sidekick traveling salesman problem in which parcels are delivered to customers by either a truck or a set of identical flying drones. The flights of the drones are limited by the battery endurance and each flight is made of a launch, a service to a customer, and a return: launch and return must happen when the truck is stationary. These operations require time and when multiple drones are launched and/or collected at the same node, their order becomes relevant. The proposed model takes into account the order of these operations as a scheduling problem, because ignoring it could lead to infeasible solutions in the reality due to the possible exceeding of the drones endurance. We propose a set of novel formulations for the problem that can improve the size of the largest instances solved in the literature. We provide a comparison among the formulations, between the multiple drones solutions and the single drone ones, and among different variants of the model. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

abstract={In this paper we consider a problem related to deliveries assisted by an unmanned aerial vehicle, so-called drone. In particular we consider the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem, in which a truck and a drone cooperate to deliver parcels to customers minimizing the completion time. In the following we improve the formulation found in the related literature. We propose three-indexed and two-indexed formulations and a set of inequalities that can be implemented in a branch-and-cut fashion. The methods that we propose are able to find the optimal solution for most of the literature instances. Moreover, we consider two versions of the problem: one in which the drone is allowed to wait at the customers, as in the literature, and one in which waiting is allowed only in flying mode. The solving methodologies are adapted to both versions and a comparison between the two is provided. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The flying sidekick traveling salesman problem (FS-TSP) is a parcel delivery problem arising in the last-mile logistics, where the distribution plan of a driver-operated truck assisted by a drone (unmanned aerial vehicle, UAV) has to be defined. The FS-TSP is a variant of the TSP where routing decisions are integrated with customer-to-drone and customer-to-truck assignment decisions and truck-and-drone synchronization constraints. The objective is the minimization of the time required to serve all the customers, taking into account drone payload capacity and battery power constraints. In this work we provide a new representation of the FS-TSP based on the definition of an extended graph. This representation allows to model the problem by a new and compact integer linear programming formulation, where the synchronization issue is tackled in a column generation fashion, thus avoiding the usage of big-M constraints, representing one of the main drawbacks of the models present in literature. The proposed formulation has been solved by an exact approach which combines a Branch-and-Cut algorithm and a column generation procedure, strengthened by variable fixing strategies and new valid inequalities specifically defined for the problem. The proposed method has been experienced on a large set of benchmark instances. Computational results show that the proposed approach either is competitive or outperforms the best exact approach present in literature for the FS-TSP. Indeed, it is able to provide the optimal solution for all small size instances with 10 customers and for several medium size instances with 20 customers, some of them never solved before. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Drones and unmanned vehicles in general are gaining more and more interest in the logistic sector, due to the potential economic advantages they can provide. In this paper we focus on optimizing the use of a drone in conjunction with a truck for urban deliveries, dealing with what is called the flying sidekick traveling salesman problem. There is a set of customers that it is possible to serve either by a truck or by a drone. The target is to minimize the total time required to complete deliveries to all the customers. In this paper we show how an effective and simple random restart local search heuristic algorithm can be derived from a known mixed integer programming model for the problem. © 2021 ACM.},

abstract={The flying sidekick traveling salesman problem (FSTSP) is an extension of the classic TSP, where a truck and drone are used to deliver packages to customers. A notable feature of the FSTSP is that a drone needs travel with a truck under synchronization constraints. Based on variable neighborhood search (VNS), a hybrid immune algorithm (HIA) is presented to solve the FSTSP with the target of minimizing the total operational cost. VNS includes basic VNS (BVNS) method used in the stage of generating the initial population and general VNS (GVNS) method used in the process of improving memory cells. Randomized variable neighborhood descent (RVND) is used as the local search method for GVNS, which applies a random neighborhood ordering. The proposed algorithm is compared with two existing methods in the literature. The experimental results show that HIA is very competitive and provides state-of-the-art solutions for most instances. In addition, our approach is more stable. © 2021 IEEE},

abstract={Speedy delivery of products is important for customers and the optimization of the last mile has particular challenges. In recent years drone-supported delivery has become increasingly feasible and therefore a topic of intense research. In this paper we address a traveling salesman problem where a truck has to serve customers and can use drones as flying sidekicks for the delivery of parcels. The goal is to assign customers to be either served by the truck or by some drone and schedule all events in order to minimize the total completion time of whole operation. We propose a heuristic for this problem, and introduce several novel components, including a multi-armed bandit selection for partitioning customers, an efficient matching-based heuristic for assigning drones to customers, local searches to improve solutions, and a fast greedy scheduler to estimate solution quality. In computational experiments we show that the combined approach finds better solutions than current methods, in less time. © 2021 IEEE},

abstract={The integration of new distribution technologies in the delivery systems, specifically drones, has been investigated by several companies to reduce the last mile logistic costs. The most promising delivery system, in terms of emissions and completion time reduction, consists of a truck and a drone operating in tandem for the parcel delivery to the customers. This has led to the definition of new and complex routing problems that have received great attention by the operations research community. Several contributions have appeared in the last years providing ILP and MILP formulation for these kinds of problems. Nevertheless, due to complexity, their solutions is impracticable even on small instances. In particular, the synchronization and the coordination of the two vehicles represent critical issues. In this work, we investigate the possibility of using customer characterizing features which allow to determine a priori promising customer-to-vehicle assignments. This information can be used to perform several variable fixings in the FSTSP formulation, so reducing the size and the complexity of the instances to be solved. Thus, the final aim is to determine optimal or sub-optimal solutions using state-of-the-art solver on a reduced FSTSP. To this aim, we provide a computational study proving the quality of the chosen features and their effectiveness in the solution of new and literature instances. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles for delivery service has been drawing attention in the logistics industry. Since commercial unmanned aerial vehicles have fundamental limitations on payloads and battery capacities, hybrid ground vehicle and unmanned aerial vehicle models have been actively investigated as practical solutions. However, these studies have focused on linehaul (delivery) demands, excluding a large number of backhaul (pickup) demands. If we consider both demands at the same time, an empty unmanned aerial vehicle that finished linehaul service can be immediately used to serve a backhaul customer. In this study, we investigate the differences that arise by considering backhauls as an additional element of the routing problem. A mixed integer linear programming model is developed, and a heuristic is constructed to solve large-scale problems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we compare it to existing models using a real-world example. Our solution is also evaluated based on experiments employing a large number of randomly generated datasets. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In this work we focus on the flying sidekick traveling salesman problem (FS-TSP). The FS-TSP arises in the last-mile distribution context and it is a variant of the TSP aimed at determining the distribution plan of a driver-operated truck assisted by a drone (unmanned aerial vehicle, UAV), where the synchronization between the two vehicles allows to parallelize the delivery operations, so providing a reduction of the overall completion time. Several variants of the FS-TSP have been considered in literature, most of them sharing the assumption that launching and rendezvous position of a drone sortie must be different. In this work, we relax this assumption allowing the truck to wait for the drone at the launching position (FS-TSP*). This introduces an important flexibility element to deal with deliveries in rural or in urban areas with no-fly zones. We propose an original and compact integer linear programming formulation which allows to exactly solve the FS-TSP*and consequently also the FS-TSP. The results on several test instances show that our method can effectively solve to optimality instances with up to 20 customers and quantify the advantages of the FS-TSP*with respect to FS-TSP in terms of overall completion time. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={This paper considers a mixed integer linear programming model that aims to minimize the total cost of routing a truck-drone tandem while considering pickup and delivery operations. In addition, the model proposes a new approach for battery swapping that optimizes drone energy replenishment. The model is validated through different scenarios with varying cost and network parameters to observe whether the corresponding changes in the system are logical. The results were able to show that the proposed battery swap approach improved the solution obtained in the context of a min-cost model. In addition, increasing the drone-truck speed ratio was observed to reduce the total cost incurred in routing the truck-drone tandem on a network. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={This research considers unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that may travel at varying speeds in a last-mile delivery system involving a single truck and a fleet of UAVs. In existing truck-and-UAV delivery models that assume constant or unlimited UAV endurance, the natural conclusion is that operating UAVs at higher speeds will either decrease, or have no adverse effect on, total delivery times. However, in reality, UAV power consumption is a nonlinear function of both speed and parcel weight; flying at high speeds can dramatically reduce flight ranges, thus limiting the effectiveness of these logistics systems. This paper addresses the tradeoffs between speed and range in a new variant of the combined truck/UAV delivery problem in which UAV speeds are treated as decision variables. A three-phased algorithm is provided that dynamically adjusts UAV speeds to achieve superior performance, with the goal of minimizing the total delivery time (or makespan). Results indicate that significant time savings can be achieved by operating UAVs at variable speeds. Furthermore, under certain conditions, optimizing UAV speeds also results in shorter truck travel distances, reduced UAV energy consumption per trip, and less UAV loitering while waiting to rendezvous with the truck. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper considers a last-mile delivery system in which a delivery truck operates in coordination with a fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or drones). Deploying UAVs from the truck enables customers located further from the depot to receive drone-based deliveries. The problem is first formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP). However, owing to the computational complexity of this problem, only trivially-sized problems may be solved directly via the MILP. Thus, a heuristic solution approach that consists of solving a sequence of three subproblems is proposed. Extensive numerical testing demonstrates that this approach effectively solves problems of practical size within reasonable runtimes. Additional analysis quantifies the potential time savings associated with employing multiple UAVs. The analysis also reveals that additional UAVs may have diminishing marginal returns. An analysis of five different endurance models demonstrates the effects of these models on UAV assignments. The model and heuristic also support anticipated future systems that feature automation for UAV launch and retrieval. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The efficiency and dynamism of unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, have presented substantial application opportunities in several industries in the last years. Notably, logistic companies have given close attention to these vehicles to reduce delivery time and operational cost. A variant of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), called the flying sidekick traveling salesman problem, was introduced involving drone-assisted parcel delivery. The drone launches from the truck, proceeds to deliver parcels to a customer, and then is recovered by the truck at a third location. While the drone travels through a trip, the truck delivers parcels to other customers as long as the drone has enough battery to hover waiting for the truck. This work proposes a hybrid heuristic where the initial solution is created from the optimal TSP solution reached by a TSP solver. Next, an implementation of the general variable neighborhood search is employed to obtain the delivery routes of truck and drone. Computational experiments show the potential of the algorithm to improve significantly delivery time. Furthermore, we provide a new set of instances based on the well-known traveling salesman problem library instances. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={The truck-drone hybrid delivery system uses a truck as a station for drones in addition to its delivery function and is getting attention because the strengths of these individual vehicles can be selectively and synergistically exploited. In this study, we extended the previous vehicle routing models to the hybrid delivery systems by taking into account two important practical issues: the effect of parcel weight on drone energy consumption and restricted flying areas. The flight range of the drones is heavily susceptible to the loaded weight due to the limited battery life. Drones are also not allowed to fly over sensitive facilities regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or temporarily in certain areas due to weather-related conditions. We developed a mathematical model that incorporates these issues and propose a two-phase constructive and search heuristic algorithm to provide computational efficiency of the real-world cases problems. The result of the numerical study demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, commonly known as drones, have attained considerable interest in recent years due to the potential of revolutionizing transport and logistics. Amazon were among the first to introduce the idea of using drones to deliver goods, followed by several other distribution companies working on similar services. The Traveling Salesman Problem, frequently used for planning last-mile delivery operations, can easily be modified to incorporate drones, resulting in a routing problem involving both the truck and aircraft. Introduced by Murray and Chu (2015), the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem considers a drone and truck collaborating. The drone can be launched and recovered at certain visits on the truck route, making it possible for both vehicles to deliver goods to customers in parallel. This generalization considerably decreases the operational cost of the routes, by reducing the total fuel consumption for the truck, as customers on the routes can be serviced by drones without covering additional miles for the trucks, and hence increase productivity. In this paper a mathematical model is formulated, defining a problem similar to the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem, but for the capacitated multiple-truck case with time limit constraints and minimizing cost as objective function. The corresponding problem is denoted the Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones. Due to the difficulty of solving large instances to optimality, an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search metaheuristic is proposed. Finally, extensive computational experiments are carried out. The tests investigate, among other things, how beneficial the inclusion of the drone-delivery option is compared to delivering all items using exclusively trucks. Moreover, a detailed sensitivity analysis is performed on several drone-parameters of interest. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), or drones, have the potential to reduce cost and time in last mile deliveries. This paper presents the scenario which a drone works in collaboration with a delivery truck to distribute parcels. This Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) variant has some particularities that make the originals constraints insufficient. In more detail must be considered the flying time-limit of the drone that inhibits them from visiting all customers and the parcel must not exceed the payload of the drone. To solve the problem, the initial solution is created from the optimal TSP solution obtained by the Concorde solver. Next, an implementation of the Randomized Variable Neighborhood Descent (RVND) heuristic is used as a local search to obtain the problem solution. To test the proposed heuristic, 11 instances based on the well-known TSP benchmark set were created. Computational experiments show the use of drones for last mile delivery can reduce the total delivery time up to almost 20%. Moreover providing a faster delivery this system has a positive environmental impact as it reduces the truck travel distance. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In the domain of logistic operations, last mile delivery by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (drones) has created quite a buzz recently. Considering that traditional truck delivery cost for "one minute per driver per day over the course of a year adds up to $14.5 million" [1], it needs to be ensured that the cost of setting up the infrastructure for deploying UAVs for parcel deliveries is offset by the time-money saved. Little research, however, has been conducted on the optimal routing and scheduling problem. A notable exception is the work of. Murray, et al. [2], who introduces the parallel truck and UAV Flying Sidekick TSP (FSTSP) model. In their work, it is assumed that the flight speeds are constant, yet this might be infeasible in practice when including the environmental effect of different wind velocities. In this paper, we consider the effect of wind and UAV battery-power consumption. The UAV is allowed to fly at certain airspeeds that optimize either airtime, distance flown, or power consumption. Experimental scenarios using different wind-velocities and number of delivery points have been simulated and the tour completion time metric is compared.},

abstract={Once limited to the military domain, unmanned aerial vehicles are now poised to gain widespread adoption in the commercial sector. One such application is to deploy these aircraft, also known as drones, for last-mile delivery in logistics operations. While significant research efforts are underway to improve the technology required to enable delivery by drone, less attention has been focused on the operational challenges associated with leveraging this technology. This paper provides two mathematical programming models aimed at optimal routing and scheduling of unmanned aircraft, and delivery trucks, in this new paradigm of parcel delivery. In particular, a unique variant of the classical vehicle routing problem is introduced, motivated by a scenario in which an unmanned aerial vehicle works in collaboration with a traditional delivery truck to distribute parcels. We present mixed integer linear programming formulations for two delivery-by-drone problems, along with two simple, yet effective, heuristic solution approaches to solve problems of practical size. Solutions to these problems will facilitate the adoption of unmanned aircraft for last-mile delivery. Such a delivery system is expected to provide faster receipt of customer orders at less cost to the distributor and with reduced environmental impacts. A numerical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the heuristics and investigates the tradeoffs between using drones with faster flight speeds versus longer endurance. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},
