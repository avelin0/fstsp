Abstract = {Once limited to the military domain, unmanned aerial vehicles are now
   poised to gain widespread adoption in the commercial sector. One such
   application is to deploy these aircraft, also known as drones, for
   last-mile delivery in logistics operations. While significant research
   efforts are underway to improve the technology required to enable
   delivery by drone, less attention has been focused on the operational
   challenges associated with leveraging this technology. This paper
   provides two mathematical programming models aimed at optimal routing
   and scheduling of unmanned aircraft, and delivery trucks, in this new
   paradigm of parcel delivery. In particular, a unique variant of the
   classical vehicle routing problem is introduced, motivated by a scenario
   in which an unmanned aerial vehicle works in collaboration with a
   traditional delivery truck to distribute parcels. We present mixed
   integer linear programming formulations for two delivery-by-drone
   problems, along with two simple, yet effective, heuristic solution
   approaches to solve problems of practical size. Solutions to these
   problems will facilitate the adoption of unmanned aircraft for last-mile
   delivery. Such a delivery system is expected to provide faster receipt
   of customer orders at less cost to the distributor and with reduced
   environmental impacts. A numerical analysis demonstrates the
   effectiveness of the heuristics and investigates the tradeoffs between
   using drones with faster flight speeds versus longer endurance. (C) 2015

Title = {On the min-cost Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone},

Abstract = {Over the past few years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), also known as
   drones, have been adopted as part of a new logistic method in the
   commercial sector called ``last-mile delivery{''}. In this novel
   approach, they are deployed alongside trucks to deliver goods to
   customers to improve the quality of service and reduce the
   transportation cost. This approach gives rise to a new variant of the
   traveling salesman problem (TSP), called TSP with drone (TSP-D). A
   variant of this problem that aims to minimize the time at which truck
   and drone finish the service (or, in other words, to maximize the
   quality of service) was studied in the work of Murray and Chu (2015). In
   contrast, this paper considers a new variant of TSP-D in which the
   objective is to minimize operational costs including total
   transportation cost and one created by waste time a vehicle has to wait
   for the other. The problem is first formulated mathematically. Then, two
   algorithms are proposed for the solution. The first algorithm (TSP-LS)
   was adapted from the approach proposed by Murray and Chu (2015), in
   which an optimal TSP solution is converted to a feasible TSP-D solution
   by local searches. The second algorithm, a Greedy Randomized Adaptive
   Search Procedure (GRASP), is based on a new split procedure that
   optimally splits any TSP tour into a TSP-D solution. After a TSP-D
   solution has been generated, it is then improved through local search
   operators. Numerical results obtained on various instances of both
   objective functions with different sizes and characteristics are
   presented. The results show that GRASP outperforms TSP-IS in terms of
   solution quality under an acceptable running time.},

Abstract = {This paper considers a last-mile delivery system in which a delivery
   truck operates in coordination with a fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles
   (UAVs, or drones). Deploying UAVs from the truck enables customers
   located further from the depot to receive drone-based deliveries. The
   problem is first formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP).
   However, owing to the computational complexity of this problem, only
   trivially-sized problems may be solved directly via the MILP. Thus, a
   heuristic solution approach that consists of solving a sequence of three
   subproblems is proposed. Extensive numerical testing demonstrates that
   this approach effectively solves problems of practical size within
   reasonable runtimes. Additional analysis quantifies the potential time
   savings associated with employing multiple UAVs. The analysis also
   reveals that additional UAVs may have diminishing marginal returns. An
   analysis of five different endurance models demonstrates the effects of
   these models on UAV assignments. The model and heuristic also support
   anticipated future systems that feature automation for UAV launch and
   retrieval.},

Title = {An adaptive large neighborhood search metaheuristic for the vehicle
   routing problem with drones},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES},

Volume = {102},

Abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, commonly known as drones, have attained
   considerable interest in recent years due to the potential of
   revolutionizing transport and logistics. Amazon were among the first to
   introduce the idea of using drones to deliver goods, followed by several
   other distribution companies working on similar services.
   The Traveling Salesman Problem, frequently used for planning last-mile
   delivery operations, can easily be modified to incorporate drones,
   resulting in a routing problem involving both the truck and aircraft.
   Introduced by Murray and Chu (2015), the Flying Sidekick Traveling
   Salesman Problem considers a drone and truck collaborating. The drone
   can be launched and recovered at certain visits on the truck route,
   making it possible for both vehicles to deliver goods to customers in
   parallel. This generalization considerably decreases the operational
   cost of the routes, by reducing the total fuel consumption for the
   truck, as customers on the routes can be serviced by drones without
   covering additional miles for the trucks, and hence increase
   productivity.
   In this paper a mathematical model is formulated, defining a problem
   similar to the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem, but for the
   capacitated multiple-truck case with time limit constraints and
   minimizing cost as objective function. The corresponding problem is
   denoted the Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones. Due to the difficulty
   of solving large instances to optimality, an Adaptive Large Neighborhood
   Search metaheuristic is proposed. Finally, extensive computational
   experiments are carried out. The tests investigate, among other things,
   how beneficial the inclusion of the drone-delivery option is compared to
   delivering all items using exclusively trucks. Moreover, a detailed
   sensitivity analysis is performed on several drone-parameters of
   interest.},

Abstract = {The efficiency and dynamism of unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, have
   presented substantial application opportunities in several industries in
   the last years. Notably, logistic companies have given close attention
   to these vehicles to reduce delivery time and operational cost. A
   variant of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), called the flying
   sidekick traveling salesman problem, was introduced involving
   drone-assisted parcel delivery. The drone launches from the truck,
   proceeds to deliver parcels to a customer, and then is recovered by the
   truck at a third location. While the drone travels through a trip, the
   truck delivers parcels to other customers as long as the drone has
   enough battery to hover waiting for the truck. This work proposes a
   hybrid heuristic where the initial solution is created from the optimal
   TSP solution reached by a TSP solver. Next, an implementation of the
   general variable neighborhood search is employed to obtain the delivery
   routes of truck and drone. Computational experiments show the potential
   of the algorithm to improve significantly delivery time. Furthermore, we
   provide a new set of instances based on the well-known traveling
   salesman problem library instances.},

Abstract = {The truck-drone hybrid delivery system uses a truck as a station for
   drones in addition to its delivery function and is getting attention
   because the strengths of these individual vehicles can be selectively
   and synergistically exploited. In this study, we extended the previous
   vehicle routing models to the hybrid delivery systems by taking into
   account two important practical issues: the effect of parcel weight on
   drone energy consumption and restricted flying areas. The flight range
   of the drones is heavily susceptible to the loaded weight due to the
   limited battery life. Drones are also not allowed to fly over sensitive
   facilities regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or
   temporarily in certain areas due to weather-related conditions. We
   developed a mathematical model that incorporates these issues and
   propose a two-phase constructive and search heuristic algorithm to
   provide computational efficiency of the real-world cases problems. The
   result of the numerical study demonstrates the effectiveness and
   efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the traveling salesman problem with drone (TSP-D),
   in which a truck and drone are used to deliver parcels to customers. The
   objective of this problem is to either minimize the total operational
   cost (min-cost TSP-D) or minimize the completion time for the truck and
   drone (min-time TSP-D). This problem has gained a lot of attention in
   the last few years reflecting the recent trends in a new delivery method
   among logistics companies. To solve the TSP-D, we propose a hybrid
   genetic search with dynamic population management and adaptive diversity
   control based on a split algorithm, problem-tailored crossover and local
   search operators, a new restore method to advance the convergence and an
   adaptive penalization mechanism to dynamically balance the search
   between feasible/infeasible solutions. The computational results show
   that the proposed algorithm outperforms two existing methods in terms of
   solution quality and improves many best known solutions found in the
   literature. Moreover, various analyses on the impacts of crossover
   choice and heuristic components have been conducted to investigate their
   sensitivity to the performance of our method.},

Abstract = {The deployment of drones to support the last-mile delivery has been
   initially attempted by several companies such as Amazon and Alibaba. The
   complementary capabilities of the drone and the truck pose an innovative
   delivery mode. The relevant optimisation problem associated with this
   new mode, known as the travelling salesman problem with drone (TSP-D),
   aims to find the coordinated routes of a drone and a truck to serve a
   list of customers. In practice, managers sometimes intend to attain a
   compromise between operational cost and completion time. Therefore, this
   article addresses a bi-objective TSP-D considering both objectives. An
   improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (INSGA-II) is proposed
   to solve the problem. Specifically, the label algorithm-based decoding
   method, the fast non-dominated sorting approach, the crowding-distance
   computation procedure, and the local search component are devised to
   accommodate the features of the problem. Furthermore, the first Pareto
   front obtained by the INSGA-II is improved by a post-optimisation
   component. Computational results validate the competitive performance of
   the proposed algorithm. Meanwhile, the trade-off analysis demonstrates
   the relationship between operational cost and completion time and
   provides managerial insights for managers designing reasonable
   compromise routes.},

Abstract = {Efficiently handling last-mile deliveries becomes more and more
   important nowadays. Using drones to support classical vehicles allows
   improving delivery schedules as long as efficient solution methods to
   plan last-mile deliveries with drones are available. We study exact
   solution approaches for some variants of the traveling salesman problem
   with drone (TSP-D) in which a truck and a drone are teamed up to serve a
   set of customers. This combination of truck and drone can exploit the
   benefits of both vehicle types: the truck has a large capacity but
   usually low travel speed in urban areas; the drone is faster and not
   restricted to street networks, but its range and carrying capacity are
   limited. We propose a compact mixed-integer linear program (MILP) for
   several TSP-D variants that is based on timely synchronizing truck and
   drone flows; such an MILP is easy to implement but nevertheless leads to
   competitive results compared with the state-of-the-art MILPs.
   Furthermore, we introduce dynamic programming recursions to model
   several TSP-D variants. We show how these dynamic programming recursions
   can be exploited in an exact branch-and-price approach based on a set
   partitioning formulation using ng-route relaxation and a three-level
   hierarchical branching. The proposed branch-and-price can solve
   instances with up to 39 customers to optimality outperforming the
   state-of-the-art by more than doubling the manageable instance size.
   Finally, we analyze different scenarios and show that even a single
   drone can significantly reduce a route's completion time when the drone
   is sufficiently fast.},

Abstract = {In this paper we consider a problem related to deliveries assisted by an

   Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem, in which a truck and a drone

   The methods that we propose are able to find the optimal solution for
   most of the literature instances. Moreover, we consider two versions of
   the problem: one in which the drone is allowed to wait at the customers,
   as in the literature, and one in which waiting is allowed only in flying
   mode. The solving methodologies are adapted to both versions and a
   comparison between the two is provided.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we are interested in studying thetraveling salesman
   problem with drone(TSP-D). Given a set of customers and a truck that is
   equipped with a single drone, the TSP-D asks that all customers are
   served exactly once and minimal delivery time is achieved. We provide
   two compact mixed integer linear programming formulations that can be
   used to address instances with up to 10 customer within a few seconds.
   Notably, we introduce a third formulation for the TSP-D with an
   exponential number of constraints. The latter formulation is suitable to
   be solved by a branch-and-cut algorithm. Indeed, this approach can be
   used to find optimal solutions for several instances with up to 20
   customers within 1 hour, thus challenging the current state-of-the-art
   in solving the TSP-D. A detailed numerical study provides an in-depth
   comparison on the effectiveness of the proposed formulations. Moreover,
   we reveal further details on the operational characteristics of a
   drone-assisted delivery system. By using three different sets of
   benchmark instances, consideration is given to various assumptions that
   affect, for example, technological drone parameters and the impact of
   distance metrics.},

Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {120},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This research considers unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that may travel
   at varying speeds in a last-mile delivery system involving a single
   truck and a fleet of UAVs. In existing truck-and-UAV delivery models
   that assume constant or unlimited UAV endurance, the natural conclusion
   is that operating UAVs at higher speeds will either decrease, or have no
   adverse effect on, total delivery times. However, in reality, UAV power
   consumption is a nonlinear function of both speed and parcel weight;
   flying at high speeds can dramatically reduce flight ranges, thus
   limiting the effectiveness of these logistics systems. This paper
   addresses the tradeoffs between speed and range in a new variant of the
   combined truck/UAV delivery problem in which UAV speeds are treated as
   decision variables. A three-phased algorithm is provided that
   dynamically adjusts UAV speeds to achieve superior performance, with the
   goal of minimizing the total delivery time (or makespan). Results
   indicate that significant time savings can be achieved by operating UAVs
   at variable speeds. Furthermore, under certain conditions, optimizing
   UAV speeds also results in shorter truck travel distances, reduced UAV
   energy consumption per trip, and less UAV loitering while waiting to
   rendezvous with the truck.},

Title = {A column-and-row generation approach for the flying sidekick travelling
   salesman problem},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {124},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The flying sidekick traveling salesman problem (FS-TSP) is a parcel
   delivery problem arising in the last-mile logistics, where the
   distribution plan of a driver-operated truck assisted by a drone
   (unmanned aerial vehicle, UAV) has to be defined. The FS-TSP is a
   variant of the TSP where routing decisions are integrated with
   customer-to-drone and customer-to-truck assignment decisions and
   truck-and-drone synchronization constraints. The objective is the
   minimization of the time required to serve all the customers, taking
   into account drone payload capacity and battery power constraints. In
   this work we provide a new representation of the FS-TSP based on the
   definition of an extended graph. This representation allows to model the
   problem by a new and compact integer linear programming formulation,
   where the synchronization issue is tackled in a column generation
   fashion, thus avoiding the usage of big-M constraints, representing one
   of the main drawbacks of the models present in literature. The proposed
   formulation has been solved by an exact approach which combines a
   Branch-and-Cut algorithm and a column generation procedure, strengthened
   by variable fixing strategies and new valid inequalities specifically
   defined for the problem. The proposed method has been experienced on a
   large set of benchmark instances. Computational results show that the
   proposed approach either is competitive or outperforms the best exact
   approach present in literature for the FS-TSP. Indeed, it is able to
   provide the optimal solution for all small size instances with 10
   customers and for several medium size instances with 20 customers, some

Title = {An exact solution method for the TSP with Drone based on decomposition},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& OPERATIONS RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {127},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone (TSP-D) is a routing model in
   which a given set of customer locations must be visited in the least
   amount of time, either by a truck route starting and ending at a depot
   or by a drone dispatched from the truck en route. We study the TSP-D
   model and propose a mixed-integer programming formulation which exploits
   the model's structure and decomposes it into two natural decision
   stages: (1) selecting and sequencing a subset of customers served by the
   truck and (2) planning where to execute drone direct dispatches from the
   truck to each of the remaining customer locations. We design a
   Benders-type decomposition algorithm, strengthened by valid inequalities
   arising from structural properties of optimal solutions, and improved
   optimality cuts stemming from the notions of t-shortcut and t-reduction,
   which might be of independent interest. Finally, our solution approach
   is empirically tested over an extensive family of randomly generated
   instances, which show its effectiveness. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {This article considers a version of the flying sidekick traveling
   salesman problem in which parcels are delivered to customers by either a
   truck or a set of identical flying drones. The flights of the drones are
   limited by the battery endurance and each flight is made of a launch, a
   service to a customer, and a return: launch and return must happen when
   the truck is stationary. These operations require time and when multiple
   drones are launched and/or collected at the same node, their order
   becomes relevant. The proposed model takes into account the order of
   these operations as a scheduling problem, because ignoring it could lead
   to infeasible solutions in the reality due to the possible exceeding of
   the drones endurance. We propose a set of novel formulations for the
   problem that can improve the size of the largest instances solved in the
   literature. We provide a comparison among the formulations, between the
   multiple drones solutions and the single drone ones, and among different
   variants of the model.},

Abstract = {The use of drones in urban logistics is gaining more and more interest.
   In this paper we consider the flying sidekick traveling salesman
   problem, where some customers require a delivery and they can be served
   either by a truck or by a drone. The aim is minimizing the total time
   required to service all the customers.
   We present a branch and bound algorithm especially designed to
   efficiently target small instances up to 15 customers and a heuristic
   algorithm, using the branch and bound as a subroutine, to attack larger
   instances. Extensive experimental results suggest the effectiveness of
   the exact solver for small instances and shows that the heuristic is
   able to provide state-of-the-art results for medium/large instances. (C)

Title = {A multi-agent approach to the truck multi-drone routing problem},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {195},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {In this work, we address the Truck-multi-Drone Team Logistics Problem
   (TmDTL), devoted to visit a set of points with a truck helped by a team
   of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones in the minimum time,
   starting at a certain location and ending at a different one. It is an
   enhanced version of the multiple Flying Sidekicks Traveling Salesman
   Problem (mFSTSP) presented in Murray and Raj (2020) wherein drones are
   allowed to visit several customers per trip. In order to cope with large
   instances of the complex TmDTL, we have developed a novel agent-based
   method where agents represent the points that are going to be visited by
   vehicles. Agents evolve by means of movement inside a grid (locations
   vs. vehicles) according to a set of rules in the seek of better
   objective function values. Each agent needs to explore only a fraction
   of the complete problem, sharing its progress with the rest of the
   agents which are coordinated by one central agent which helps to
   maintain an asynchronous memory of solutions - e.g. on the control of
   the mechanism to escape from local minima. Our agent-based approach is
   firstly tested using the largest instances of the single TDTL problem
   reported in the literature, which additionally serves as upper bounds to
   the TmDTL problem. Secondly, we have solved instances up to 500
   locations with up to 6 drones in the fleet. Thirdly, we have tested the
   behavior of our approach in 500 locations problems with up to 8 drones
   in order to test the fleet size sensitivity. Our experiments demonstrate
   the ability of the proposed agent-based system to obtain good quality
   solutions for complex optimization problems that arise. Further, the
   abstraction in solutions coding applied makes the agent-based approach
   scalable and flexible enough to be applied to a wide range of other
   optimization problems.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles for delivery service has been drawing
   attention in the logistics industry. Since commercial unmanned aerial
   vehicles have fundamental limitations on payloads and battery
   capacities, hybrid ground vehicle and unmanned aerial vehicle models
   have been actively investigated as practical solutions. However, these
   studies have focused on linehaul (delivery) demands, excluding a large
   number of backhaul (pickup) demands. If we consider both demands at the
   same time, an empty unmanned aerial vehicle that finished linehaul
   service can be immediately used to serve a backhaul customer. In this
   study, we investigate the differences that arise by considering
   backhauls as an additional element of the routing problem. A mixed
   integer linear programming model is developed, and a heuristic is
   constructed to solve large-scale problems. To demonstrate the
   effectiveness of our model, we compare it to existing models using a
   real-world example. Our solution is also evaluated based on experiments
   employing a large number of randomly generated datasets.},

Title = {Optimization of Truck-Drone Parcel Delivery Using Metaheuristics},

Abstract = {This research addresses a variant of the traveling salesman problem in
   drone-based delivery systems known as the TSP-D. The TSP-D is a
   combinatorial optimization problem in which a truck and a drone
   collaborate to deliver parcels to customers, with the objective of
   minimizing the total delivery time. Determining the optimal solution is
   NP-hard; thus, the size of the problems that can be solved optimally is
   limited. Therefore, metaheuristics are used to solve the problem.
   Metaheuristics are adaptive and intelligent algorithms that have proved
   their success in many similar problems. In this study, a solution to the
   TSP-D problem using the greedy, randomized adaptive search procedure
   with two local search alternatives and a self-adaptive neighborhood
   selection scheme is presented. The proposed approach was tested on 200
   instances with different properties from the publicly available
   ``Instances of TSP with Drone{''} benchmark. Results were evaluated
   against state-of-the-art algorithms. Non-parametric statistical tests
   concluded that the proposed approach has comparable performance to the
   rival algorithms (p = 0.074) in terms of tour duration. The proposed
   approach has better or similar performance in instances where the drone
   and truck have the same speed (alpha = 1).},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present a routing heuristic for the Flying Sidekick
   Traveling Salesman Problem. This problem combines a single truck with a
   single drone. The drone may be launched from the truck from a customer
   location and can make a single package delivery before being recovered
   by the truck. While the drone is in flight, the truck can deliver
   packages independently. The problem is one of simultaneously assigning
   the customers to each vehicle and determining the synchronized routes
   for both vehicles to satisfy all customer demands in the shortest time
   possible. The problem is NP-hard. Our main contribution lies in
   developing a novel split algorithm that utilizes a shortest path
   approach for determining the optimal routing solution to a given order
   of customer locations. This split algorithm has polynomial complexity.
   We develop a heuristic solution to the problem by combining the split
   algorithm with local search techniques. This overall heuristic is shown
   to be accurate and computationally scalable to large, realistically
   sized problems applicable in last-mile logistics.},

Title = {Optimal Route Planning for Truck-Drone Delivery Using Variable
   Neighborhood Tabu Search Algorithm},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The optimal delivery route problem for truck-drone delivery is defined
   as a traveling salesman problem with drone (TSP-D), which has been
   studied in a wide range of previous literature. However, most of the
   existing studies ignore truck waiting time at rendezvous points. To fill
   this gap, this paper builds a mixed integer nonlinear programming model
   subject to time constraints and route constraints, aiming to minimize
   the total delivery time. Since the TSP-D is non-deterministic
   polynomial-time hard (NP-hard), the proposed model is solved by the
   variable neighborhood tabu search algorithm, where the neighborhood
   structure is changed by point exchange and link exchange to expand the
   tabu search range. A delivery network with 1 warehouse and 23 customer
   points are employed as a case study to verify the effectiveness of the
   model and algorithm. The 23 customer points are visited by three
   truck-drones. The results indicate that truck-drone delivery can
   effectively reduce the total delivery time by 20.1\% compared with
   traditional pure-truck delivery. Sensitivity analysis of different
   parameters shows that increasing the number of truck-drones can
   effectively save the total delivery time, but gradually reduce the
   marginal benefits. Only increasing either the truck speed or drone speed
   can reduce the total delivery time, but not to the greatest extent.
   Bilateral increase of truck speed and drone speed can minimize the
   delivery time. It can clearly be seen that the proposed method can
   effectively optimize the truck-drone delivery route and improve the
   delivery efficiency.},

Title = {The flying sidekick traveling salesman problem with stochastic travel
   time: A reinforcement learning approach},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {164},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {As a novel urban delivery approach, the coordinated operation of a
   truck-drone pair has gained increasing popularity, where the truck takes
   a traveling salesman route and the drone launches from the truck to
   deliver packages to nearby customers. Previous studies have referred to
   this problem as the flying sidekick traveling salesman problem (FSTSP)
   and have proposed numerous algorithms to solve it. However, few studies
   have considered the stochasticity of the travel time on the road
   network, mainly caused by traffic congestion, harsh weather conditions,
   etc, which heavily impacts the speed of the truck, thus affecting the
   drone's operations and overall delivery routine. In this study, we
   extend the FSTSP with stochastic travel times and formulate the problem
   into a Markov decision process (MDP). The model is solved using
   reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms including the deep Q-network
   (DQN) and the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm to overcome the
   curse of dimensionality. Using an artificially generated dataset that
   was widely accepted as benchmarks in the literature, we show that the
   reinforcement learning algorithms also perform well as approximate
   optimization algorithms, outperforming a mixed integer programming (MIP)
   model and a local search heuristic algorithm on the original FSTSP
   without the stochastic travel time. On the FSTSP with stochastic travel
   time, the reinforcement learning algorithms obtain flexible policies
   that make dynamic decisions based on different traffic conditions on the
   roads, saving up to 28.65\% on delivery time compared with the MIP model
   and a dynamic local search (DLS) algorithm. We also conduct a case study
   using real-time traffic data collected in a middle-sized city in the
   U.S. using Google Map API. Compared with a benchmark calculated by the
   DLS, the DRL approach saves 32.68\% total delivery time in the case
   study, showing great potential for future practical adoption.},

Abstract = {Synchronous delivery with different vehicles, as an emerging concept of
   the delivery network, improves the efficiency of the modern logistics
   system significantly, which gradually gives birth to a new issue: the
   traveling salesman problem with drone (TSP-D). In this paper, we propose
   a one-truck-multiple-drone (OTMD) model on the base of the TSP-D.
   Compared with the traditional one-truck-one-drone (OTOD) and multiple
   drones models, our scheme introduces a united objective function into
   the optimization calculation. In terms of the proposed multiple levels
   iterative theory, we can compute the optimal synchronous delivery
   network that takes both the total delivery time and the number of drones
   into consideration. Four types of customer distributions are employed to
   investigate the OTMD model and its associated calculation approaches.
   Comparing the parameters of the optimal network in different delivery
   models, we study the relationship among the total delivery time,
   customer distribution and the number of serving drones. These simulation
   results verify the feasibility and practicality of the OTMD, and
   demonstrate the features of optimization calculation with different
   customer distributions, being beneficial to improve the efficiency of
   the model logistics system.},

Title = {Optimizing the Hub-and-Spoke Network with Drone-Based Traveling Salesman
   Problem},
Journal = {DRONES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The hub-and-spoke network (HSN) design generally assumes direct
   transportation between a spoke node and its assigned hub, while the
   spoke's demand may be far less than a truckload. Therefore, the total
   number of trucks on the network increases unnecessarily. We form a
   drone-based traveling salesman problem (TSP-D) for the cluster of spokes
   assigned to a hub. A truck starts from the hub, visiting each spoke node
   of the hub in turn and finally returning to the hub. We propose a
   three-stage decomposition model to solve the HSN with TSPD (HSNTSP-D).
   The corresponding three-stage decomposition algorithm is developed,
   including cooperation among variable neighborhood search (VNA)
   heuristics and nearest neighbor algorithm (NNA), and then the
   spoke-to-hub assignment algorithm through the reassignment strategy (RA)
   method. The performance of the three-stage decomposition algorithm is
   tested and compared on standard datasets (CAB, AP, and TR). The
   numerical analysis of the scenarios shows that whether it is trunk
   hub-level transportation or drone spoke-level transportation, it
   integrates resources to form a scale effect, which can reduce transport
   devices significantly, as well as decreasing the investment and
   operating costs.},

Abstract = {Utilization of drones (also known as unmanned aerial vehicles) can
   largely improve the performance of mobile crowdsensing (MCS) such that
   the drones can serve as mobile participants for task executions and
   therefore increase the service range. In this paper, we introduce a
   truck-drones MCS model by jointly considering the use of truck and
   drones for task executions. In this model, drones are scheduled to
   launch from the truck, perform one or more tasks, and rendezvous with
   the truck for battery swap while the truck can simultaneously serve as a
   mobile hub and also a mobile task executor. The design objective is to
   minimize the total cost for the truck and drones' movement, as well as
   the driver's payment in the MCS process. This problem is formulated as a
   mixed integer linear programming problem. We further propose an
   efficient algorithm based on variable neighborhood search to achieve
   efficient joint task assignment and path planning. Numerical results
   show the high efficacy of the proposed algorithm and also the benefit of
   joint use of truck and drones for mobile crowdsensing.},
